# Contributing to zetaglest.github.io

Thank you your interest in this project!

This repo is for the [ZetaGlest web site](https://zetaglest.github.io/docs/).

The guidelines for contributing are the same for the [ZetaGlest source
code](https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-source), and can be found
in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-source/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
(link leads to a different repository in the [ZetaGlest
organization](https://github.com/ZetaGlest)). That document also
contains the instructions for performing pull requests. The only
difference is that this repo uses the **master** branch.

For information about working on this site or the other ZetaGlest web
site (a site that displays game statistics is in another repo), see the
[WEBSITE_DESIGN.md](https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-source/blob/develop/WEBSITE_DESIGN.md)
document.
