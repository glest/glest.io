To test any design changes locally, you'll need to install jekyll.
You'll find the documentation for that on the jekyll website.

[Jekyll installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

Once you have jekyll installed, in the glest.github.io repo
directory, run

    bundle install
    
to automatically install any required gems. Then

    bundle exec jekyll serve

You can then view the site in your web browser at http://localhost:4000
