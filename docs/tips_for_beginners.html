<h3>Playing for the First Time</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Learn one faction at a time (this helps you remember in which
  order to build things, what's needed for upgrades, and other
  basics)</li>
  <li>Play 1 or 2 of the tutorials before trying to play in a network game</li>
</ol>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>These are some terms or phrases used in the <i>ZetaGlest</i> world:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>RTS</i> - real-time-strategy</li>
  <li><i>coop or co-op</i> - A game where you play against the CPU (AI/Artificial Intelligence) with human teammates</li>
  <li><i>pvp</i> - Person versus person game</li>
  <li><i>push</i> - when usesd during a game, it means your teammate is
  directing you to send your units to move forward and attack, instead of holding
  position and defending your existing territory</li>
  <li><i>b</i> - back, go back, retreat</li>
  <li><i>re</i> - quit and restart the game; most often used in co-op
  games when everyone has accepted that the CPU will win.</li>
  <li><i>splash damage</i> - when attacking, the damage some units
  cause will <i>splash</i> to surrounding units, damaging them, yours,
  and your allies'. For instance, if a catapult fires at an archer,
  there will also be damage to units standing near the archer. The
  catapult can also destroy itself, so be careful! There are no obvious
  ways to see what units cause splash damage (but we plan to address
  that with <a
  href="https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-source/issues/78">ticket
  #78</a>). The <a href="https://zetaglest.github.io/">techtree information
  here</a> will show you if a unit causes splash damage, and if it only
  damages the enemy, or all units.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving</h3>
<p>With units selected, right-clicking on a map area will direct them to attack enemy units once they are in visible range.</p>
<p>Retreating: to move without attack mode use a double right mouse click, the "m" key, or the "move" icon.</p>
<p>Note: when units are attacking and you try to move them using a single-right click (which defaults to attack), they will continue attacking and not move to the specified location.</p>

<h3>Map selection</h3>
<p>When setting up a game, you do not always have to scroll through a lot of maps<br />
to get to the one you want. For example, if you want a map that starts with "p", hold down<br />
<i>shift + p</i> and click the arrow next to the map selection box.</p>

<h3>Signal a location to other players</h3>
<p>Hold down "x" and click on the location in which you would like to signal.<br />
That area will blink to other players on the mini-map (upper left-corner) and an<br />
audible alert will sound.</p>

<h3>Playing with experienced players</h3>
<p>Many players enjoy games with new players. Before joining a network game, simply<br />
tell them you are new, and ask if it's ok for you to join.</p>
