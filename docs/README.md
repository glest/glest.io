# Glest

**Official Website: https://glest.io**

The site published in the docs is generated by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

To test any design changes locally, you'll need to install jekyll.
You'll find the documentation for that on the jekyll website.

[jekyll installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

Once you have jekyll installed, in the glest.github.io repo
directory, run

    bundle install
    
to automatically install any required gems. Then

    jekyll serve

You can then view the site in your web browser at http://localhost:4000
Click the link for **Game Help and Documentation** to take you to the
jekyll site.
