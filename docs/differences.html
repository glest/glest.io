title: Differences from MegaGlest
layout: default
---
<p>
  These are the chief ways that Glest is different from MegaGlest:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Players can "zoom-out" during network games (see the whole map and all areas not clouded by Fog Of War</li>
  <li>If a player doesn't have enough resources to produce or build a unit, the icon/button to build it is disabled</li>
  <li>Buildings will now still be built even when units are in the way, and construction doesn't get cancelled if a unit moves over it before construction has begun</li>
  <li>GlestPack has replaced Megapack</li>
  <li>Four factions have been added
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Glest/glest-data/tree/develop/techs/glestpack/factions/the_great_ming">The Great Ming</a></li>
      <li><a href="/greece_overview.html">Greece</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Glest/glest-data/tree/develop/techs/glestpack/factions/japanese">Japanese</a></li>
      <li><a href="/natulka_overview.html">Natulka (Prax)</a></li>
    </ul>
  <li>The lobby test scenario has been removed.</li>
  <li>
    Key changes: M for Move, H for chat history, T for team chat
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The default command is "attack". That means when you right-click on
    a location, units go into attack-mode. As a result, using "a" is not needed.</p>

    <p>Retreating: to move without attack mode use a double right mouse
    click, the "m" key, or the "move" icon.</p>

    <p>After they are produced, units go into attack-mode upon exiting a
    barracks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Healers such as the priest, shaman, engineer, technician, etc can auto-heal
    when in range of mobile units (within a radius of 15 cells). Each healer adds
    5 regeneration points to units within range (i.e. 10 healers add 50 regeneration
    points).
  </li>
  <li>
    If playing <a href="/magic_overview.html">Magic</a>
    or <a href="/norsemen_overview.html">Norse</a>,
    mobile units standing within a range of 8 cells from an Archmage
    tower or a Valhalla will be auto-healed (adds 5 regeneration points
    per building)
  </li>
  <li>
    The CPU is more difficult. For instance, If before you had trouble
    beating a Mega 2.5, you will probably have to change the Mega to a
    2.0
  </li>
  <li>
    Magic and <a href="/tech_overview.html">Tech</a> have
    been rebalanced, to make them more competitive with the other
    factions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Observers aren't required to use slots on the map. If you are
    playing a 4-player map, observers can be in slots 5 - 10.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    Other changes not directly related to game-play: added factions,
    some new graphics and sound effects
  </li>
</ul>
