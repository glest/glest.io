<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This strategy guide is based on Napoleonic and West Point military
strategy. To be covered will be the basic tips for new RTS(Real Time
Strategy) game players and general principles of military strategy.
Glest factions will also be covered.</p>

<h3>Basic Tips for New RTS Players</h3>

<p>
  Make workers early and constantly throughout the game. The earlier
  a worker begins gathering resources the more that worker is worth.
  Make a new worker for gathering resources or building stuff at
  least twice a minute. Make your gold and resources work for you. If
  you have excess resources they are not getting "interest" spend
  them on buildings, workers, or combat units Scout and explore, know
  when an enemy attack is coming, know the terrain, and know where
  resources are. Practice your order of build and base layout to make
  sure you get the most use out of each building and unit. Some
  buildings make great walls ;) Only send your units(with the
  exception of units you are using as scouts) towards the enemy in
  groups. Units used for scouts are expendable workers and builders
  are not. In early game focus on a mix of cheap, light, and fast
  units for early raids. A raid is where you send units for the
  purpose of killing enemy workers and vulnerable economic buildings.
  Every worker unit that you manage to wipe out is lost time and gold
  for the enemy. Loosing workers early is a death sentence. Later in
  the game you may want to switch to using a single large main battle
  group with large numbers of high quality units.
<p>
<h3>Four General Principles of Military Strategy</h3>
<p>
  Defeat the enemy in Detail. Concentrate the forces of your main
  battle group on a smaller number of enemy units. If your units kill
  them faster they take less damage and the enemy units can fire fewer
  attacks. Also make sure all of your units can support one another so
  that you do not become a victim of defeat in detail. Control the
  Center. The center of the map between both bases is the position of
  the most power. Controlling the center allows fastest access to areas
  on the map and allows greater map control. Any attack from the enemy
  has to go through the center if they want their attack to be a
  straight line. The fastest way between two points is a straight line.
  If we can control the middle ground and center we can attack and
  respond to enemy attacks quickly. Use the terrain. Bottle necks or
  choke points are great places to defend. If the enemy army has to
  thin out to go through a bottle neck or choke point we can defeat
  their units more easily and with fewer casualties. Maintain constant
  contact with the enemy. Always keep a scout and your main battle
  group close enough to the enemy to apply pressure and respond to
  enemy troop movements. If you see your enemy building defensive
  towers and you are right there you can attack and destroy the towers
  they are building. There is a great advantage to keeping constant
  contact with your enemy.
</p>
<h3>A few other points from the Art of War:</h3>

<p>
  An army that is everywhere strong is in reality everywhere weak.
  Sometimes you can go around the strongest part of their army and
  destroy their base or other unsupported units. Be flexible to
  respond to changes your enemy makes. If your army is weak: act in
  strength, if your army is strong: act as though you are weak.
  Deception can win wars. You do not need to actually destroy an area
  to apply pressure there. The threat of attack can be used to force
  your enemy to divert forces to that area. Do not hesitate to
  retreat if the military engagement will result in a loss, retreat
  and regroup with more forces for a response. Try to engage the
  enemy when your forces have the advantage
</p>

<h3>Factions</h3>
<p>
  <i>Magic</i> is a great faction for early game mage and daemon rushes on small
  maps. Magic has a great ranged mage and arch mage unit. On larger maps
  and on team games the magic faction can fight very well with arch mages
  and evil dragons. Magic seems to struggle on middle sized maps, and
  during middle game.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Natives</i> have a great ranged units, and somewhat useful melee units. I
  use them on small maps often. Fire archers are the most handy ranged
  unit of this faction but is fragile.
</p>

<p>
  The <i>Egyptians</i> faction seems like a slower version of Magic with a
  sphinx instead of a tower. Their spear men and spear throwers are
  decent early game units. The Egyptian snake unit is very effective for
  killing land and air units with great splash damage, however the snakes
  are very slow and fragile. This faction seems to do better on larger
  maps.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Persians</i> are great for controlling larger maps with their cheap early
  game units and later game genies with their decent damage. Genies and
  Princesses will likely be the core of your army with melee to slow
  enemies and act as damage shields.
</p>

<p>
  The <i>Roman</i> foot soldiers are some of the best in the game, if combined
  with magic or Indian ranged units in team play this faction is quite
  powerful. Roman soldiers can take and deal large amounts of damage.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Norse</i> cudgel ladies and archers are good early game units, this faction
  is almost like a faster and cheaper version of the Tech faction with
  Thor units instead of Tech units. This faction early game is formidable
  and in later game its ballista units mixed with their swordsmen and
  Valkyries can be difficult to stop. In the right hands this faction is
  lethal, in the wrong hands it can be awkward and harder to play.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Tech</i> is an interesting faction, where units are poweful if upgraded
  using the blacksmith, where strong guards are strategic melee units, especially
  accompanied by an army of archers, which are some of the strongest in all
  factions. Horsemen are very useful for quick hit-and-run attacks, and must
  be used intellgently.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
  Controlling the map, building worker units early, moving from raids to
  main battle armies, and defeating your enemy bit by bit are all
  important strategies to consider when waging your war. Mastery of
  strategy can help, even if having a high number of actions per minute
  is difficult. Master the strategy and with practice a new player can
  become quite competitive quickly.
