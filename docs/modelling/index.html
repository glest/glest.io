<p>We use <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> to create or
update models. The <a
href="https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-data/issues">tickets
related to models</a> are in the data repo</p>

<p>The links on the left give detailed information about working on
models for the ZetaGlest project. (The information is not complete
yet)</p>
