<h2><span class="mw-headline"
id="Transparency">Transparency</span></h2> <p>The transparency of the
alpha component of textures can be set, where the alpha is replaced
with "teamcolor". This means you can  "see through" the teamcolor parts
of a texture. It's easier to understand by looking at examples and
trying it out. An example can be seen on the <a
href="https://github.com/Glest/glest-data/tree/develop/techs/factionpack/factions/egypt/units/priest">Egyptian
priest's</a> robe.</p>

</p>

<p>To make your own model with this feature, you need the latest <a
href="https://github.com/Glest/glest-source/tree/develop/source/tools/glexemel">g3d_support.py
script</a>. Load the script into blender as usual, and look in the g3d
panel. You should see a new slider in the panel, as seen in the image
below. This sets the &quot;transparency&quot;.</p>

<p>If the bar is greyed out, then you need to check "team color" (because
this transparency setting is meaningless without teamcolor).<p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"
id="Another_Section">Another Section</span></h2> <p>This is another section,
which has no information yet. It can also be referred to as a
<i>placeholder</i></p>
