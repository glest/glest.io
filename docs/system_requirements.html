<p>
* >= (2011) Intel Sandy Bridge x86 CPU with 1.6 GHz or higher frequency
  (modern multi-core CPU series, at least 2.0 GHz recommended)
* 2.0 GB RAM
  (4.0 GB RAM recommended)
* Graphics chip supporting OpenGL 2.1 or higher
  (dedicated/discrete video card with hardware 3D acceleration recommended)
* 512 MB video memory
* Audio chip supporting OpenAL
</p>

<h2>Software requirements:</h2>
<p>
* A supported (by its producer) operating system version
* Graphics drivers which work well with this operating system version and
  support the OpenGL requirements discussed above
* Audio drivers supporting OpenAL
* A file archiving utility which provides a command line interface and can
  decompress 7-zip archives

Graphics hardware and drivers:
Current dedicated Nvidia and AMD hardware with up to date vendor-supplied
proprietary drivers installed usually provide the best experience. However, it
is not unheard of that they may be difficult to get working on Linux and other
open platforms (due to insufficient support by hardware vendors). If you
experience such issues, open source 3D drivers are now becoming usable for both
many current and legacy GPUs, and may help with the proprietary drivers'
shortcomings.

Next to standard dedicated gaming video cards, ZetaGlest also runs fine
on most integrated Intel, Nvidia and AMD APUs. In some case, reduce
visual effects from the options menu may help improve game performance.

To run ZetaGlest in headless mode, neither video nor audio hardware and driver
support are necessary. For a good user experience, please ensure your system
meets all other minimum hardware requirements, as listed above.
