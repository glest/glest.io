Hello, everyone! We are about 2 months away from the first release. To
view more information about our road map to release, please consult the
<a href="https://zetaglest.github.io/docs/faq.html#releasedate">FAQ</a>.

If you haven't found our chat room yet, all are welcome to join us on
<a href="https://discord.gg/WaAaXS7">our Discord server</a>.

I know the biggest question is, "What makes ZetaGlest different from <a
href="https://megaglest.org/">MegaGlest</a>?" You can feel assured that
the <a href="https://zetaglest.github.io/docs/differences.html">Differences
from MegaGlest page</a> will answer that question!

With regard to changes, bug fixes, and feature additions in the current
code and data, we've been noting them in the <a
href="https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-source/blob/develop/ChangeLog.md">ChangeLog</a>;
but now that we have this blog, we'll try to post the most significant
updates in a timely manner, in paragraph (not ChangeLog) form. Please
subscribe to the <a href="https://zetaglest.github.io/feed.xml">RSS
feed</a> and try to contain your excitement.

You want mods? We've added several. If you have access to a development
snapshot binary, remember to check the mod center next time you run ZG for new
items!

Thank you for your participation.
